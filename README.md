# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict student performance using classical Machine Learning algorithms.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using widely used supervised ML techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Summary
The goal of this project is to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on features like study hours, attendance, and past academic performance. The model compares different algorithms to identify which performs best.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing with **pandas** and **NumPy**
- Implementation of multiple ML algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Train–test split and feature scaling
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Dataset
This project uses a simple dataset with the following features:

- `study_hours`
- `attendance`
- `past_score`
- `passed` (target: 0 = fail, 1 = pass)

You may either:
- generate synthetic data inside the notebook, or  
- use a small CSV dataset.
